            This document is meant to highlight all of the important gameplay aspects shown and/or
            mentioned in Klepto’s Early Access Streams on 10/23-10/25. Keep in mind to <b>take everything
            listed here with a grain of salt</b>, that anything listed here is subject to change and is not set in
            stone, and that this list is also purely based on what is done or heard from the Webmasters in the
            stream. This is SOLELY OBSERVATION. Bugs will also not be listed, as many of those are
            currently getting looked at and fixed. Thanks again to Klepto for streaming the gameplay!

All three will be different species from each other. You will be asked to select one of them. You will do this process three different times, and all nine Bakugan you see total will be different from one another. The three you select will be your starting Bakugan. Their base G-Powers will also most likely be lower than what they would be if purchased from the shop.</li>

         <li>Two Bakugan from one team standing on the same Gate Card without initiating battle IS ALLOWED in this game, no card effect or ability necessary. I believe this will add a lot more in terms of strategy and make things very interesting. This was done during the show a couple of times, but it was very rare, so many people thought it was against the rules (See picture below for what I mean by this).

            <em>Abilities activate in chain links, similar to Yu-Gi-Oh. When someone activates an <strong>ability</strong>, both teams will go back and forth activating their abilities. Then, when both sides pass turn, the chain resolves backwards in the order of abilities activated (The most recently activated card will resolve first, the next second, etc, the same is true for <strong>Command Cards</strong>, as their activations will also be part of the chain). This is dictated at the top of the screen. However, if a <strong>NORMAL or CHARACTER Gate Card</strong> activates in the chain, its effect immediately resolves without waiting for the chain to finish accumulating activations. (This process is subject to change).</em>

         <li>There are no draw battles. If two Bakugan battle and end up at the same G-Power when both players are done activating cards, the Bakugan who stood on the Gate Card first wins the battle automatically,</br>preventing a tie.

         <li>So far, the max amount of a specific ability card you are allowed to have in your Deck is three. Unsure if it goes any higher, but that was the highest shown on stream.</li>

         <li>According to the Webmasters in the stream, the BakuShop will give you a random set of Bakugan and cards to purchase from.
